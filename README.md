<br><br><br><br>
This app uses Lucene.Net (https://lucenenet.apache.org) to index files for fast searching.  It also uses IFilterTextReader by 
Sicos1977 to open Office docs.  All files in the depo are displayed on the right at all times.  This app uses Tooltips and JQuery to
animate loading.  Add your docs to the folder called "docFolder".
